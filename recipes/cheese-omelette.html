    <p>A perfect omelette is a fantastic and quick meal for any time of day. The key is to control your heat and not overcook the eggs.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Swiss work well)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water or milk (this helps make the eggs fluffy)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Eggs: Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Add the water or milk, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk vigorously with a fork or whisk until the yolks and whites are completely combined and slightly frothy.</li>
        <li>Heat the Pan: Place an 8-inch non-stick skillet over medium to medium-low heat. Add the butter and let it melt and bubble, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. The butter is ready when the foaming subsides.</li>
        <li>Cook the Omelette: Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan. Let it cook for about 20-30 seconds until the edges just begin to set. Use a rubber spatula to gently push the cooked edges toward the center, tilting the pan so the uncooked egg runs underneath.</li>
        <li>Add Cheese and Fold: When the omelette is mostly set but still a little wet on top (about 1-2 minutes total), sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over one half of the eggs.</li>
        <li>Finish and Serve: Use the spatula to carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the cheese. Let it cook for another 30 seconds, or until the cheese is melted. Gently slide the omelette from the pan onto a plate. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
