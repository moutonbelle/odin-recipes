    <p>This is a classic Italian dish that proves you only need a few quality ingredients to make a delicious and satisfying meal in under 20 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz (about half a box) of spaghetti or linguine</li>
        <li>4-6 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup good quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (or more if you like it spicy)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>(Optional) Grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add a generous amount of salt (it should taste like the sea). Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
        <li>Saut√© the Garlic: While the pasta is cooking, pour the olive oil into a large skillet or pan. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Turn the heat to medium-low. Cook gently for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is fragrant and lightly golden. Do not let it burn, or it will become bitter.</li>
        <li>Combine: Just before the pasta is done, use a mug to reserve about one cup of the starchy pasta water. Drain the pasta and immediately add it to the skillet with the garlic and oil.</li>
        <li>Make the Sauce: Turn the heat up to medium, add about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water to the skillet, and toss everything together vigorously for about 1-2 minutes. The starchy water will combine with the olive oil to create a simple, creamy sauce that coats the noodles. If it looks dry, add another splash of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, topped with Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
