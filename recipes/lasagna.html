    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dish made of layers of noodles, meat sauce, and bechamel.</p>
    <p>The best version I've ever had came from the restaurant Cafelatte in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the Meat Sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 lb Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry red wine (like Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon), optional</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the Béchamel Sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk, warmed</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg, freshly grated</li>
        <li>Salt and white pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the Lasagna Assembly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping</li>
        <li>2 lbs whole milk mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:
            <ol>
                <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and Italian sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>If using, pour in the red wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let the wine reduce by about half.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Add the oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 1 hour, or up to 3 hours for a richer flavor. Stir occasionally.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:
            <ol>
                <li>While the meat sauce simmers, prepare the béchamel. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until it forms a smooth paste (this is a roux).</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in the warm milk until the sauce is smooth. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the nutmeg, salt, and white pepper.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Lasagna Noodles:
            <ul>
                <li>If using regular noodles: Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions until al dente. Drain and lay them flat on a lightly oiled baking sheet to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>If using no-boil noodles: You can proceed directly to assembly. They will cook in the sauce.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten egg, and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna:
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Top with a layer of meat sauce, followed by a generous layer of shredded mozzarella and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Spoon a thin layer of béchamel sauce over the mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, the remaining ricotta mixture, meat sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan, and béchamel.</li>
                <li>For the final layer, place the remaining noodles on top, spread with the rest of the meat sauce and béchamel, and top generously with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Bake and Rest:
            <ol>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with foil, making sure the foil doesn't touch the cheese (you can tent it slightly).</li>
                <li>Bake for 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving. This will help the layers set and make for cleaner slices.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious, homemade classic lasagna!</p>
